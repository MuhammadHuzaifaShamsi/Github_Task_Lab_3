Algorithm
Task 1

1. Ask the user to enter the number they want to check as a divisor – `num` (e.g. 4).
2. Ask the user to enter the number they want to check the divisor for – `n` (e.g. 16).
3. Check if `num` is a divisor of `n` using the modulo operator: `n % num == 0` (e.g. 16 % 4 == 0).
4. IF `n % num == 0`, THEN:
a. Check if num is even or odd by using the modulo operator: `num % 2 == 0` (e.g. 4 % 2 ==
0).
b. IF `num % 2 == 0`, THEN display that “the num is an even number”.
c. ELSE display that “the num is an odd number”.
5. ELSE display that “the num is not a divisor of n”.
6. End.
